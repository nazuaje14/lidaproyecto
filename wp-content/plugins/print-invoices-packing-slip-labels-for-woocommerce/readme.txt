== Description ==

= Introduction =

 WooCommerce Print Invoice, Packing Slip, Delivery Note & Label plugin helps you generate WooCommerce PDF Invoices, WooCommerce Packing Lists / WooCommerce Packing Slips, WooCommerce Delivery Notes and WooCommerce Shipping Labels from the WooCommerce orders page. WooCommerce, by default, doesn't allow to print any of these documents from your orders page. Using this extension, you can very well streamline your online business.

= Why do you need Invoice, Packing List, etc? =

It is a good practice to include an invoice and packing list when you are shipping a package. It serves as a confirmation of what the package contains along with your contact information and the details of the purchase. 

When you sell internationally, it is a standard requirement in many countries to include an invoice. The Invoice should contain all the required order details such as name and address of your company, billing address of your customer, and a list of all order items including taxes and totals.

Furthermore, it establishes an extra line of communication between you and the customer and adds a human touch.
